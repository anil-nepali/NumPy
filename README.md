# 📊 NumPy Essentials

Welcome to my NumPy learning repository! This repo contains my practice files, exercises, and notes while learning NumPy — a fundamental library for numerical computing in Python.

## 📌 What is NumPy?

NumPy (Numerical Python) is an open-source Python library used for working with arrays. It provides:

- High-performance multidimensional arrays
- Tools for mathematical operations, statistics, and linear algebra
- Efficient broadcasting and vectorization
- Integration with other data science libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn

## ⚙️ Key Features

- Support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices
- Fast element-wise operations
- Built-in mathematical functions (like `mean`, `sum`, `dot`)
- Powerful indexing and slicing
- Memory-efficient compared to native Python lists

## 📚 Resources I Used

- [NumPy Documentation](https://numpy.org/learn/)
- [W3Schools NumPy Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/python/numpy/)
- [NumPy YouTube Tutorial ](https://youtu.be/-TYSM0CDA4c?feature=shared)

## 🧠 Topics Covered

- Installation and Basics (`pip install numpy`)
- NumPy Arrays (1D, 2D, nD)
- Array Indexing & Slicing
- Array Math Operations
- Random Numbers and Statistics
- Reshaping and Flattening
- Aggregations (`sum`, `mean`, `std`)
- Broadcasting
- Performance comparison with Python lists
- with pratice questions

## 🚀 How to Run

```bash
# Make sure NumPy is installed
pip install numpy

# Run any of the example files
python filename.py
